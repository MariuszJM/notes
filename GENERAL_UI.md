For Zahid:
Could you provide me some background for this project?
What is the project's name?
Who is the primary user or target audience for the project?
Who will sign off on the project once it's completed?
What is the scope of the project? I think I should inform user about our limitations of environment at the beginning.
What is the deadline for the project?


For Lukas
    General UI
        Should I send an agenda before the meeting with Zahid?
        Should I turn on the camera during the meeting even if no one else does?
        What do you think about shared document, as a way for communication?
        Where can I store the document to not make chaos.
        I think I should inform user about our limitations of environment at the beginning.
        Do you know som project where Angular is integrated with Python?
    Others
